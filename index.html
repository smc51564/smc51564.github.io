	<p>
	The University of Georgia Stress Dog Day is organized by students, for students. This event consists of the local animal shelter providing a plethera of dogs and bringing them to campus for students to meet. These shelter dogs are full of love and ready for a pat. Not only will you feel relief but these dogs will feel love that they don't get a lot of in the shelter.

	<H2> <font face="Snap ITC">Why go?</font> </H2>
	<p>
	<abbr title=”StressDogDay”>SDD</abbr> is important because the University of Georgia is one of the top public schools in the nation and with that comes hard work and a lot of stress. It is a proven fact that dogs relieve stress. Petting a dog is not only going to be the highlight of your day, but it is scientifically proven that it will also lower your heart rate. During a week full of exams and essays, being in a room full of dogs can introduce laughter into a week of horror.

	<p>
	 The Athens Area Humane Society is a donor supported no-kill 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to lowering area euthanasia rates through adoption, spay/neuter, and pet retention programs. It is so important to focus on the rescue and care of animals who would otherwise be euthanized. They are a group of animal welfare activists who started Athens Area Humane Society nearly three decades ago. Their mission is to rescue, spay/neuter, and find homes for animals in Georgia and beyond. They love their animals and we are so lucky to be partnering with them for this event.
